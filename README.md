## Introduction

This repository includes a collection of simple applications and exercises designed to teach and demonstrate various SQL concepts and techniques. The assignments cover a range of topics from basic queries to advanced database management using Microsoft SQL Server.

## Features

- **Basic SQL Queries**: Learn how to perform basic SQL operations like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
- **Advanced SQL Queries**: Explore more complex queries including JOINs, subqueries, and aggregations.
- **Database Design**: Understand database design principles through practical assignments.
- **Stored Procedures and Functions**: Implement stored procedures and functions to encapsulate business logic.
- **Data Management**: Techniques for managing and manipulating data efficiently.

## Installation

To work with these SQL assignments, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh

    ```
2. **Open Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** and connect to your SQL Server instance.
3. **Navigate to the project directory** and open the SQL files in SSMS.

## Usage

Each assignment is contained in its own SQL file. Open the file in SSMS and execute the scripts as instructed within the file. The scripts are designed to be run sequentially, so follow the comments and instructions provided to understand and complete each assignment.
